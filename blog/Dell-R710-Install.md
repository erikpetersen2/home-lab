# Installing VMWare ESXi on a Dell PowerEdge R710

As many home lab enthusiasts have had before me, I had a problem: I needed more <b><i>POWAH</b></i>. From the 
virtual machines I was running for teaching and my own research/practice to the desire to offload some of those 
virtual machines from my desktop to free up its resources to the realization that for the services I was running, a 
cloud container platform may not be the most economically viable decision... I needed to beef up the private side of 
my hybrid cloud environment. While for enterprises, the predictable, scalable IaaS model works extremely well, that is 
not necessarily the case when it comes to a home lab or small business. The math for an enterprise may be (in a very 
basic sense) "It's cheaper to run a server for $300/month than it is to pay $10k for a new physical server," while 
the math for me is more "Do I want to spend $40/month for this cloud server or buy a 10-year-old enterprise server for 
less than $200?" I chose the latter.
