#Home Lab Blog
Here you will find a collection of personal musings and notes related to my home lab. Notes are generally organized
by topic, although you may find this section of the repository is a little more "free-form" as notes are added in 
the moment and organized later once a project or project portion is complete. For a glance at all of my projects,
head over to https://erikpetersen.tech!
